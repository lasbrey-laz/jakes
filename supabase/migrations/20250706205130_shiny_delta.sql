  # Fix Public Access to Categories and Products

  1. Security Updates
    - Allow public read access to categories
    - Allow public read access to active products
    - Keep write operations secure (admin/vendor only)
    - Maintain existing security for profiles and orders

  2. Changes
    - Update categories policies for public read access
    - Update products policies for public read access
    - Keep all other security measures intact
